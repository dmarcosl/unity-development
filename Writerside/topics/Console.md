# Console

At the left, the console has four buttons:

* **Clear**, clears all the current log messages.
* **Collapse**, collapses multiple repeated log messages into a single line with a count.
* **Clears on Play**, clears all the current logs at push the Play button.
* **Error Pause**, halts or pauses the game when an error message is logged.

At the right, it has three buttons for toggling info-level messages, warning-level messages and error-level messages.

The body is split in two panels:

* The top panel list all the logs, showing only the name.
* The bottom panel shows all the info of the log that is selected.
