# Providing Critique

Avoid

* **Unclear** - I don't like it
* **Overly Personal** - I don't like dark color schemes
* **Apathy** - It seems okay, let's go with it
* **Too much negativity** - I don't like that or that or that!

The **Critique Sandwich** is a way to "sandwich" negative feedback between praise

1. **Positive Feedback** - I really like the way your character move
2. **Critical Feedback** - When they jump, it feels unrealistic
3. **More Positive Feedback** - Overall the animations are starting to look very polish

Things to look for

* Story
* Fun / Enjoy the Gameplay
* Progression
* Art Consistency
* Graphics Quality
* Is it fit for our target market?
