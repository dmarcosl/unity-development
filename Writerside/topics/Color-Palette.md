# Color Palette

![](image29.png)

In a conic palette:

* **Hue** is rotating the color
* **Chroma** is the saturation which goes from white to the color
* **Value** is the brightness which goes to the color to black

The Hue must be chosen by selecting the colours close to each other on the color wheel. Like Red, Scarlet and Purple.

Complementary colours are the opposite. Like Red and Green. This is used to create highlights.

To vary the brightness of the colour, keep the hue and saturation constant.

### How art choices affect mood

Desaturation is good to create a dark and scary mood.

Very close Hue colours and low saturation for a grungy mood.

Complementary colours and high saturation is for cartoony looking mood.

High saturation and bright looks photorealistic grungy state getting with the lower saturation.

### Unifying Colour

Ensure colours will look pleasant

Consistent with your desired mood

Less 'noise' by limiting colours
