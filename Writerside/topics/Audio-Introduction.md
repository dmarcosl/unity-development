# Audio Introduction

Sounds are emitted by objects and heard by listeners. The way a sound is perceived depends on a number of factors. A listener can tell roughly which direction a sound is coming from and may also get some sense of its distance from its loudness and quality.

A fast moving sound source, like a falling bomb, will change in pitch as it moves as a result of the Doppler Effect. Also, the surroundings will affect the way sound is reflected, so a voice inside a cave will have an echo but the same voice in the open air will not.
