# Look-and-feel Imagery

Concept art is a form of illustration used to convey an idea before it is put into the final product.

It is developed through several iterations:

* Sketching
* Shading and refining
* 3D modeling
* Refining the 3D model

Concept art is not only used to develop the work, but also to show the progress to directors, clients and investors.
