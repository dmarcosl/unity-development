# Hierarchy

The Hierarchy is responsible for list and organize the GameObjects in the scene. Organize can mean sorting and reordering but also creating parent-child relationships between GameObjects.

When you move a parent, you also move the child.

There are two sort patterns:

* **Alphabetical Sort**, sort by name.
* **Transform Sort**, sort by the order that the objects has been created.

To enable Alphabetical Sort, go to Edit (Unity on Mac) → Preferences → General and Enable Alpha Numeric Sorting.

You can duplicate, remove, rename or create GameObjects in the Hierarchy.

Doing a right click in the hierarchy shows a list of categories, each one with a list of presets.

You can also access to that categories by the option GameObjects of the navbar.
