# Summary

This notes were taken for the [Unity Developer Certification 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K7rxCVqFbWSuhPdCSwzr8DEzWyyzjwlp/view?usp=share_link) (now deprecated) but remain useful for current Unity versions and for beginners.

I used as reference the version of Unity that was available at the time, version 5.4. Unity has evolved a lot since its current version, but most of the notes are still relevant because they cover basic concepts.
