# Project

In this view you can access and manage the assets of the project.

It is composed by:

## Top bar

At the left is the Create button, that allows to create folders and assets, like materials, sprites, etc.

At the right is the Search text-box, where you can search by typing in it.

At the right of the text-box there are three buttons.

* The first, the **objects icon**, allows to search by asset types.
* The second, the **label icon**, allows to search by label (group files even between folders)
* The third, the **star icon**, save the search in favorites.

You can combine a search by text and with the button filters.

The searches allow to show also content of the Asset Store.

## Panels

The left panel shows the folder structure in a hierarchical list, and when a folder is selected, its content is shown in the right panel.

The right panel also shows the result of the searches.

Above the left panel is the favourites section, where you can add searches by clicking the star button of the top bar after doing a search.

To rename a saved search, slow left click twice.

By clicking the windows menu, you can switch to one column, hiding the left panel.

By right click on the right panel, you can:

* Create assets and folders (the same as the button of the top bar)
* Open the current folder in the Operative System folder navigator
* Import asset from outside of the project (the same and draw and drop the asset to the right panel)
* Import/Export packages

## Bottom bar

At the left is the name of the object or folder selected.

At the right is a slider that zoom in/out the items of the right panel. At the minimum value, the items are shown as a list.
